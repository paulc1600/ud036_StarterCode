Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

  Udacity Course: Full Stack Web Developer
  Proj #1: Movie Website
  Purpose: write server-side code to store a list of favorite movies,
            including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. Code
            is used to generate a static web page allowing visitors to
            browse a set of movies and watch the trailers.

  Files:   entertainment_center -- main code
           ec_create_csv.py     -- creates text file with Movies db
           ec_read_csv.py       -- reads Movies db into py list
           media_file.py        -- Creates Class Movie from list
           fresh_tomatoes.py    -- Creates HTML for website and calls
                                     browser.       
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  DISCLAIMER: Most of fresh_tomatoes and media file is borrowed from 
              code provided in "Programming Foundations with Python". 

              Even though I didn't pay for a private GitHub
              repository, please do not alter this code unless
              you are an Udacity instructor. Initially at least
              I would like to make my own homework mistakes.  ;-)

              Many thanks. -- Paul
